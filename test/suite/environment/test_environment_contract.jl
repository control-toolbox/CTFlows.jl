    _silent_cuda_guard_offenders()

Recursively find, under `test/suite/` (located via `@__DIR__`, not `pwd()`), source lines
that either define a local CUDA-device predicate (`is_cuda_on()` / `_cuda_on()`) or open an
`if` block directly on one (`if is_cuda_on()`, `if _cuda_on()`, `if CUDA.functional()`) —
the anti-pattern consolidated into `Main.TestCapabilities.CUDA_FUNCTIONAL` by this fix (see
issue #375 / CTSolvers.jl#190). A bare device `if` makes a correctly-skipped run (no device,
as expected on a dev machine) and a silently-broken run (device *should* be present but
isn't) produce the same output: a green testset with zero assertions.

The fix is `if Main.TestCapabilities.CUDA_FUNCTIONAL ... else Test.@test_skip ... end`, with
the device tier made *required* on the GPU runners centrally, in the testset below.

This file is excluded from the walk: it necessarily spells out the very patterns it searches
for (regex source, comments).
